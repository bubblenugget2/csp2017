      <p>My name is Jorge Molina and I am 17 years old,currently a senior at Santa Ana High school. </p>
      <p>This summer I took a cyber boot camp that taught me about basic HTML,CSS, and Python.</p>
      <p>At the cyber boot camp we got an award for completing the program at Santa Ana High School with our finished projects.</p>
      <p>Coastline Community College also gave me an award for attending their Cyber security program.</p>
      <p>I wanted to take this course because I enjoy learning about coding and Cyber security .</p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy to skate ,code and learn more about cyber security.</p>
